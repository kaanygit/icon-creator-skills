# icon-creator-skills

Open-source agent skills toolkit for **icon and mascot generation** with multi-platform asset packaging. Built on OpenRouter image models, designed to drop into Claude Code, OpenCode, and any agent harness that supports the skill format.

> Status: **planning phase**. No code yet. This repo currently contains the full design and phased build plan.

---

## What it does

You write a description, optionally drop a reference image, and get back:

- A polished icon or mascot generated through OpenRouter
- A vectorized SVG (when the input is suitable)
- A ready-to-ship asset pack: iOS `AppIcon.appiconset/`, Android `mipmap-*/` + adaptive icons, Web favicons + manifest, macOS, watchOS, Windows tiles
- For mascots: pose variants, expression variants, character sheet, social/sticker/print packs

All driven by a Python skill triggered through your agent of choice.

## The 6 skills

| Skill | Purpose | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| **icon-creator** | Single icon (app icon, favicon, UI icon, logo-mark) | [docs/skills/icon-creator.md](docs/skills/icon-creator.md) |
| **icon-set-creator** | Coherent icon family (e.g. 12 navigation icons in matching style) | [docs/skills/icon-set-creator.md](docs/skills/icon-set-creator.md) |
| **mascot-creator** | Brand mascot/character with poses, expressions, character sheet | [docs/skills/mascot-creator.md](docs/skills/mascot-creator.md) |
| **png-to-svg** | Bitmap → optimized SVG vectorizer (shared, also standalone) | [docs/skills/png-to-svg.md](docs/skills/png-to-svg.md) |
| **app-icon-pack** | Master image → multi-platform asset zip | [docs/skills/app-icon-pack.md](docs/skills/app-icon-pack.md) |
| **mascot-pack** | Mascot deliverables: social, sticker, print, web variants | [docs/skills/mascot-pack.md](docs/skills/mascot-pack.md) |

## Where to start reading

If you want the **30-second pitch**: [docs/vision.md](docs/vision.md)

If you want the **whole picture**: read in order — [vision](docs/vision.md) → [architecture](docs/architecture.md) → [phases overview](docs/phases/README.md).

If you want to **start building**: jump to [phases/phase-00-skeleton.md](docs/phases/phase-00-skeleton.md) and walk forward.

If you want to know **why a decision was made**: [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) is the log.

## Confirmed decisions

- **6 skills**, not fewer. Mascot ≠ icon, set generation ≠ single icon, packaging ≠ generation.
- **Monorepo** for now. Split later if any single skill grows its own audience.
- **Python**. Pillow / OpenCV / rembg / vtracer-py — image-processing ecosystem is unbeatable.
- **MIT license**. Maximum reusability.
- **OpenRouter as the only image-gen backend** in v1. User brings their own key. Replicate / fal.ai fallbacks are explicitly future work.
- **Test at every phase.** Each phase ends with concrete acceptance tests, not "looks good."

See [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) for the full rationale.
